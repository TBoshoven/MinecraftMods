Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my mods.

There are a few ways in which you can contribute:

* You can submit new [issues](https://github.com/TBoshoven/MinecraftMods/issues) to report bugs or suggest features.
* You can help diagnose issues.
* You can contribute bug fixes by forking the repository and creating a Pull Request against the appropriate branch.
  Please make sure to keep changes as small and self-contained as possible. This will help when backporting them to 
  older versions.

If you'd like to contribute larger changes, please discuss with me first using a dedicated discussion or issue.
